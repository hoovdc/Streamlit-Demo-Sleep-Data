### 4. Dashboard Data Display Issues Fix - **COMPLETED**
- **Status**: Critical bug fixed 
- **Date**: Current session
- **Issue**: Early testing raised concerns that summing **all** sleep sessions per day could inflate totals on rare "marathon-sleep" days.
- **Resolution**: After analysis we decided to **keep** the sum-of-sessions approach (it best reflects total time asleep) and instead improve explanatory notes so users understand the method.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - âœ… Updated in-app notes to clarify that totals are a *sum of all sessions* on a date
  - âœ… Verified calculations and UI match this method
  - âœ… Added multi-session detail table so users can inspect how the daily sum is built

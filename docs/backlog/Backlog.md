   - User invited to "Press Enter" in terminal to close app
   - Proper cleanup of resources on shutdown

2. **Enhanced Data Processing**
   - Google Drive API integration for automatic file sync
   - ZIP file extraction for Sleep Cloud backups
   - Data validation and cleaning pipeline improvements
   - Historical data archiving system

### Medium Priority
3. **Advanced Predictive Analytics**
   - Sleep efficiency calculations and sleep debt tracking
   - Predictive sleep quality models
   - Trend forecasting and pattern prediction
   - Weekly/monthly statistical insights with recommendations

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Mobile-responsive design optimization
   - Dark/light theme toggle
   - Custom date range filtering with presets
   - Export dashboard as PDF reports

5. **Sleep Goal & Achievement System**
   - Personal sleep target setting and tracking
   - Achievement badges and progress monitoring
   - Sleep consistency scoring system
   - Personalized recommendations based on patterns

### Low Priority
6. **Performance & Scale Optimizations**
    - Incremental data loading for large datasets
